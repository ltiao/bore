A minimalistic implementation of BORE: Bayesian Optimization as Density-Ratio Estimation [1]_
in Python 3 and TensorFlow 2.

|featured|

Getting Started
---------------

Install with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install "bore[tf]"

With support for GPU accelaration:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install "bore[tf-gpu]"

With support for HpBandSter plugin: 

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install "bore[tf,hpbandster]"

Usage/Examples
--------------

This example implements an instantiation of BORE based on a multi-layer perceptron (i.e. a fully-connected feed-forward neural network) classifier. 

First we build and compile the classifier model using ``MaximizableSequential``:

.. code-block:: python

  from bore.models import MaximizableSequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

  # build model
  classifier = MaximizableSequential()
  classifier.add(Dense(16, activation="relu"))
  classifier.add(Dense(16, activation="relu"))
  classifier.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"))

  # compile model
  classifier.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy")

This syntax should be familiar to anyone who has used a high-level neural network library such as Keras. In fact, ``MaximizableSequential`` is simply a subclass of the ``Sequential`` class from Keras. More specifically, in addition to inheriting the usual functionalities, it provides the ``argmax`` method which finds the input where the output of the model is maximized. 

Using this method, the standard optimization loop can be implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  features = []
  targets = []

  # initial design
  features.extend(features_init)
  targets.extend(targets_init)

  for i in range(num_iterations):

      # construct classification problem
      X = np.vstack(features)
      y = np.hstack(targets)

      tau = np.quantile(y, q=0.25)
      z = np.less(y, tau)

      # update classifier
      classifier.fit(X, z, epochs=200, batch_size=64)

      # suggest new candidate
      x_next = classifier.argmax(method="L-BFGS-B", num_start_points=3, bounds=bounds)

      # evaluate blackbox function
      y_next = blackbox.evaluate(x_next)

      # update dataset
      features.append(x_next)
      targets.append(y_next)

Features
--------

* BORE-MLP: BORE based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier

  * Provides higher-order functions that leverage automatic differentiation to transform Keras models into functions that can easily be optimized by methods in SciPy, not least multi-started quasi-Newton hill-climbing methods such as L-BFGS.  

Roadmap
-------

* Integration with the `Optuna <https://optuna.org/>`_ framework by implementing a `Sampler <https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.html#optuna.samplers.BaseSampler>`_ plugin.
