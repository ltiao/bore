Inspired by Peter Norvig's `pytudes <https://github.com/norvig/pytudes>`_, 
which was in turn inspired by the book "Etudes for Programmers (1978)" by 
Charles Wetherell.

    An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill.
